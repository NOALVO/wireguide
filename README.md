# Wireguide
Styleguide for low-fidelity paper prototyping and wireframing.

> _The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)._

### 1. Objectives

1.1. These guidelines are meant to be used by product owners, managers, designers or developers planning to illustrate visual representations of computer software or internet pages, a.k.a. prototyping or wireframing.

1.2. These guidelines SHOULD be used to represent low-fidelity wireframes. Therefore, rounded borders, shadows, gradients, images, icons, animations or other complex graphical elements SHOULD NOT be used.

### 2. Pen üñä

2.1. _SHOULD_ prefer using thin/sharp hydrographic pens or ballpoint pens. Avoid thick pens and markers.

2.2. _MUST NOT_ use pencils or automatic pencils in order to avoid poor visibility wireframes.

2.3. _MUST_ use black, blue, red, green and orange colors to draw elements, considering the rules below. In case you don't have green or orange colors, you MUST replace orange with red and green by black. If you don't have blue, red or black, well... you can't make a comprehensive wireframe.

### 3. Black elements üñ§ Containers

3.1. _MUST_ use **black** color for lines, containers and borders. For all, but not limited to, the following cases:
- Divs
- Panels
- Headers
- Navigation bars (both vertical and horizontal)
- Menus (tabs, navs, pills, dropdowns)
- Tables
- Text
- Images
- Modal dialogs

3.2. _MUST_ include the word `LOGO` at the beginning of **navigation bars** prefixed by a trademark or logo.

3.3. _MUST_ include close buttons (`√ó`) at the top-right corner of **modal dialogs**.

3.4. _MUST_ represent **images** by a square with an x mark touching its corners (`‚òí`).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/34.PNG)

3.5. _SHOULD_ draw only the first line of a repeating elements, followed by a vertical ellipsis (`‚ãÆ`) at the middle of  the container for **tables** and **containers**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/35.PNG)

3.6. _SHOULD NOT_ draw bottom lines for **tables** and **containers** that are taller than the wireframe. Instead, apply three dashes (like an ellipsis) from each vertical line of the container's sides.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/36.PNG)

3.7. _SHOULD NOT_ draw right/left lines for **tables** and **containers** that are wider than the wireframe. Instead, apply three dashes (like an ellipsis) from each horizontal line of container's sides.

### 4. Blue elements üíô Features

4.1. _MUST_ use **blue** color to describe features' content, origin and destination.

4.2. _MUST_ define **reference codes** for each feature with a letter, starting from `A` to `Z`.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/42.PNG)

4.3. _SHOULD NOT_ label control elements directly. Instead, prefer using the reference code described in 4.2.

4.4. _MUST_ make a "**features table**" including each component reference code and their main details. Use any free space in the wireframe. If there isn't, use the back of the sheet to make it.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/44.PNG)

4.5. _MUST_ **use double quotes (`"`) to describe labels** of items in a features table (specified by item 4.4).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/45.PNG)

4.6. _MUST_ **use right arrows (`‚Üí`) to indicate a feature's destination** when referencing it in a features table (specified by item 4.4). Like, but not limited to, opening dialogs and changing pages.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/46.PNG)

4.7. _MUST_ **use left arrows (`‚Üê`) to indicate a feature's origin** when referencing it in a features table (specified by item 4.4). Like, but not limited to, pages and other features, and also the labels' sources, like, but not limited to APIs and its internal functions.

### 5. Red elements ‚ù§Ô∏è Modifiers

5.1. _MUST_ use **red** color to indicate features' special behaviors.

5.2. _MUST_ use "blocked" signs (`üö´`) for read-only, blocked or disabled controls.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/52.PNG)

5.3. _MUST_ use triangles (`‚ñ≥`) for elements and controls affected by user roles (privileges elevation). Elements marked with both "blocked" sign and triangle will be considered not read-only if the role is satisfied. Describe further details of privileges and control behaviors in the features table.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/53.PNG)

5.4. _MUST_ use horizontal ellipsis (`...`) for elements or controls that contain or trigger AJAX loaders.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/54.PNG)

5.5. _MUST_ use vertical ellipsis (`‚ãÆ`) for elements or controls that repeat by some iteration with a vertical three-dot. Indicate more details of the iteration in the Table of Features.

### 6. Green elements üíö Controls

6.1. _MUST_ draw **input/text boxes** with just a horizontal line. DO NOT draw inputs as rectangles, as they may be confused with buttons.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/61.PNG)

6.2. _MUST_ draw **buttons** as rectangles, including **image buttons**. For buttons that have a cancel/abort/close behavior include a times character (`√ó`) aligned to its center.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/62.PNG)

6.3. _MUST_ draw **checkboxes** as squares with a chec kmark inside (`‚òë`).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/64.PNG)

6.5. _MUST_ represent **dropdown menus** writing "Dropdown", followed by a feature reference code (as described by 4.2) and a black triangle ponting down (`‚ñº`).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOALVO/wireguide/master/img/65.PNG)

6.5.1. _MUST_ draw black containers (as described in 3.1) with a diagonal line from the top to the right line of the container's top-right corner for panel menus.

6.5.2. _MUST_ include underlines (`_`) at the beginning of dropdown menu items and below their labels.

6.5.3. _MUST_ include black triangles pointing right (`‚ñ∂Ô∏é`) at the end of  dropdown items that activates another dropdown menu.

6.6. _MUST_ put dashed underlines (`_ _ _`) below their labels for **hyperlinks**.

### 7. Orange elements üíõ Illustrations and layout to be determined

7.1. _SHOULD_ draw proposals of text and illustrations that have to be officially determined with orange color.
