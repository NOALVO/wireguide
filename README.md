### 2. Pen

2.1. _SHOULD_. Prefer using thin/sharp hydrographic pens or ballpoint pens. Avoid thick pens and markers.

2.1. _MUST NOT_. Don't use pencils or automatic pencils in order to avoid poor visibility wireframes.

- Divs
- Panels
- Headers
- Navigation bars (both vertical and horizontal)
- Menus (tabs, navs, pills, dropdowns)
- Tables
- Text
- Images
